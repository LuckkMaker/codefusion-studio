# Install Segger J-Link debugger drivers

Segger's J-Link is a popular JTAG/SWD debugger supported by CodeFusion Studio. The J-Link drivers are not provided directly by CodeFusion Studio so need to be installed manually if using a J-Link.

Download and installation instructions can be found on the Segger website at [:octicons-link-external-24: https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/){:target="_blank"}
