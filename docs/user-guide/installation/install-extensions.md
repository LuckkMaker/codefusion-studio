# Installing VS Code Extensions

!!! note
    The VS Code extensions should be installed automatically as part of the installation process. This step is only required if you need to manually install an extension.

The CodeFusion Studio VS Code extensions can be found in the VS Code directory in the `CodeFusion Studio` installer.
To install the `*.vsix` file, open Visual Studio Code. From the `Extensions` tab, click `Install from VSIX...`  from the ellipses menu:

![Extension Installation](images/extension-installation-dark.png#only-dark)
![Extension Installation](images/extension-installation-light.png#only-light)

And browse to the desired *.vsix file(s) in your `<codefusion-sdk-install>/VSCode` directory.

- For the CodeFusion Studio IDE, select `cfs-ide-*.vsix`
