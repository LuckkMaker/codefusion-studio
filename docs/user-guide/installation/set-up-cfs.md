# Set up CodeFusion Studio

## Set CodeFusion Studio SDK path

The CodeFusion Studio SDK path should be set automatically during the installation process, but if it is missing or incorrect then you will be prompted to update it:

![SDK Invalid Prompt](images/sdk-path-invalid-dark.png#only-dark)
![SDK Invalid Prompt](images/sdk-path-invalid-light.png#only-light)

Click on **Download SDK** To download the SDK if it isn't already installed, or **Choose SDK path** to enter the appropriate path.  

The installation path can also be manually configured under user settings by searching for `cfs.sdk.path`.
